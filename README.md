# Swiggy Delivery Analysis 🍛📦  
**End-to-End Data Analytics & Visualization Project**

**Author:** K. Siddhartha  
**Live Demo:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/Siddhartha001/swiggy-delivery-analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **industry-grade data analytics application** that analyzes food delivery operations inspired by **Swiggy-like platforms**.

It focuses on understanding **delivery efficiency, late delivery probability, rider distance impact, and customer ratings** using Python-based data analysis and interactive visualization.

The project is fully deployable and includes a **live Gradio dashboard** hosted on Hugging Face.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze delivery time behavior and delays
- Quantify late delivery probability
- Study the relationship between rider distance and delivery duration
- Visualize insights interactively for decision-making


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy  
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- **App Framework:** Gradio  
- **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces  


## 📊 Key Features
- Synthetic but realistic delivery dataset generation
- Statistical summaries and trend analysis
- Late-delivery modeling and probability estimation
- Interactive plots with hover insights
- End-to-end pipeline from data → analysis → deployment


## 🚀 Live Application
👉 **Interactive Dashboard:**
